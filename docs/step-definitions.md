# Step Definitions

If using Cucumber, there are some Step Definitions included in the Core, simply write features using the following statements (e.g. 'I enter "Rick Sanchez" in the "input" with the "name" of "FullName"):

```
I click the {string} button *
I click the {string} link *
I enter {string} in the {string} with the {string} of {string} *
I select the {string} option {string} *
I select the answer {string} *
I select the dob {string} *
I visit the url {string} *
```

Assertions (e.g. 'it has an "h1" element with the text "Welcome to GOV.UK"):

```
it has {string} on the page *
it has a page title {string} *
it has a/an {string} element with text {string} *
```
